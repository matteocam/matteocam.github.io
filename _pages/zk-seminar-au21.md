This is the homepage for the PhD course _Techniques for Efficient Zero-Knowledge Arguments_ at Aarhus University. 

_This page is a work in progress. Stay tuned._

_The course has temporarily been postposned due to covid restrictions. We will resume as soon as it's possible to meet at the university._

## Attempted Syllabus

- The landscape of efficient arguments for NP (from which assumptions? how "efficient"?)

- GKR and variants [GKR,Hyrax]

- Compilers from information-theoretic objects (PCP, linear interactive proofs, IOPs) to arguments [Kilian,CSMicali,IKO,BCIOP,IOP]

- Commitments over polynomials with efficient evaluation [KGZ,zkVSQL,Lego]

- Some important design approaches:
    - QAP-based [QAP,SSP]
    - Groth-Sahai [GS]
    - Bulletproofs [BP]
    - Ligero [Ligero]
