I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/index.html), currently working with
[Dario Fiore](http://www.dariofiore.it/) on  efficient **Zero-Knowledge proof systems**, as well as other cryptography-flavored topics.

I received a Ph.D. from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York where I worked with [Rosario Gennaro](http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~rosario/).

## Research

In some of my latest projects I worked on questions such as:
- Can we compose *SNARKs* in an efficient and general manner? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142)
- How (not) to pay for digital goods and services on *Bitcoin*? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/566)
- Is expressive, efficient "higher" crypto (e.g. MPC, FHE, VC) possible *without cryptographic assumptions* (at the cost of being secure against "weaker" adversaries)? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/297)
- How to design protocols  for verifiable computation when a server is *economically incentivized* (and with no cryptographic assumptions)? [[thesis]](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3823&context=gc_etds)


## ZK Standards

- A proposal for the standardization of the notion of commit-and-prove [[proposal draft]](https://zkproof.org/workshop2/main.html)
- A presentation on commit-and-prove at the [[2nd ZKProof Workshop]](assets/misc/CP-standard-ZKProof-slides.pdf)
