I'm a research scientist at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai). 
I mostly work on efficient _zero-knowledge proof systems_, their building blocks, their foundations and their applications. My interest is in cryptography at large.

I previously worked as a post-doctoral researcher at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/) with [Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/) (2020-2021) and at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/index.html) with [Dario Fiore](http://www.dariofiore.it/) (2018-2020).

While at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY), I worked with [Rosario Gennaro](http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~rosario/); in 2018 both Rosario and CUNY made the careless blunder of giving me a PhD.

## Research

<sup>My work has appearead at top- and high-rank cryptographic conferences. For a full list of publications, see [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8xba6isAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Below you can find my work organized by question/topic rather than year/conference.</sup>

_In some of my latest projects I worked on questions as:_

### SNARKs (and related primitives)
- How can we best combine techniques from fast proof schemes (e.g., Spartan) with those from extremely succinct proofs (e.g., Groth16) obtaining a small (_universal_) setup?  [[Testudo paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/961.pdf) [[Testudo blog post]](https://cryptonet.org/blog/testudo-efficient-snarks-with-smaller-setups)

- How to design protocols  for verifiable computation when a server is *economically incentivized* (and with no cryptographic assumptions)?

## ZK Standards
---

I was co-chair of the working group leading the effort to standardize [(commit/encrypt)-and-prove](https://hackmd.io/@dariofiore/rkXo8EBp8) in zero-knowledge proofs. Some resources:
- A [proposal](assets/misc/zkproof-cp-standards-4th.pdf) for the standardization of the notion of _commit-and-prove_ (as well as _encrypt-and-prove_) accepted at the [4th ZKProof Workshop](https://zkproof.org).
- [Slides](assets/misc/CP-standard-ZKProof-slides.pdf) on commit-and-prove used at the [2nd ZKProof Workshop](https://zkproof.org/workshop2/main.html).
