Binary whales _might_ not exist. In constrast, I hold the belief that I do.

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/index.html), currently working with
[Dario Fiore](http://www.dariofiore.it/) on cryptographic protocols for verifiable computation.

In 2018 I received a Ph.D. from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York where I worked with [Rosario Gennaro](http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~rosario/).

You can see a list of publications on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8xba6isAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

In some of my latest projects I worked on questions such as:
- Can we compose SNARKs in an efficient and general manner? 
- How (not) to pay for digital goods and services on Bitcoin? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/566)
- Is expressive, efficient "higher" crypto (e.g. MPC, FHE, VC) possible without cryptographic assumptions (at the cost of being secure against "weaker" adversaries)? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/297)
- How to design protocols  for verifiable computation when a server is economically incentivized (and with no cryptographic assumptions)?
