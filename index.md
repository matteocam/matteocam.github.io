I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/index.html), currently working with
[Dario Fiore](http://www.dariofiore.it/) on  efficient _Zero-Knowledge proof systems_ and  other cryptography-flavored topics.

I received a Ph.D. from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York where I worked with [Rosario Gennaro](http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~rosario/).

## Research
<sup>You can find a full list of publications on [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8xba6isAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).</sup>

In some of my latest projects I worked on questions such as:
- Can we compose *SNARKs* in an efficient and general manner? [[LegoSNARK paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142) [[slides]](assets/misc/legosnark-amsterdam19.pdf)
- How can we prove efficiently and privately that an element is in a set (e.g. that a user is whitelisted) ? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1255)
- How (not) to pay for digital goods and services on *Bitcoin*? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/566)
- Is expressive, efficient "higher" crypto (e.g. MPC, FHE, VC) possible *without cryptographic assumptions* (at the cost of being secure against "weaker" adversaries)? [[paper]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/297)
- How to design protocols  for verifiable computation when a server is *economically incentivized* (and with no cryptographic assumptions)? [[thesis]](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3823&context=gc_etds) [[paper1]](assets/misc/Sequentially Composable Rational Proofs.pdf) [[paper2]]


## ZK Standards

- A [proposal](assets/misc/zkproof-cp-standards.pdf) for the standardization of the notion of _commit-and-prove_;
- [Slides](assets/misc/CP-standard-ZKProof-slides.pdf) on commit-and-prove used at the [2nd ZKProof Workshop](https://zkproof.org/workshop2/main.html).
